I've been having these problems for months and it hasn't been fixed.\", 'This app is Horrible. But all my friends are on it, so- oh! Also bad for artists who don\\'t animate on a regular basis. Everything is a \"Reel\" now, at an attempt to copy tiktok, and you\\'ll only ever see videos in your feed aside from the occasional advertisement. If you do have the option I would suggest literally almost any other app that doesn\\'t tie in with Facebook.', \"Like the majority of people, I deleted the app to take a break and came back to it not working at all. After weeks of deleting, re-downloading, reseting, ect. I still can't get it to work. When I open the app, the logo shows up then it goes black and doesn't work. It seems there is no possible way to fix this unless instagram does something about it. I miss connecting with my friends and I have probably lost a few over this because it was our only way to communicate. Instagram please fix this!üôè\"]\n"
